# ClaimWindow / sdk-adapter

Stellar SDK operation builders and XDR round-trip tests. Run `npm ci && npm test`.

Developer preview for Stellar native claimable balances. This project analyzes conditions; it does not hold keys, guarantee reclaimability under all account conditions, or submit mainnet transactions. Ledger close times use integer Unix seconds and interval ends are exclusive. Relative conditions require the original creation ledger close time, not a later modification time.

## Workspace setup
Clone the five repositories under https://github.com/claimwindow-labs into one directory with their repository names. The timeline and API import the adjacent predicate-engine.

## Contributions
See CONTRIBUTING.md. Test failures and minimal counterexamples are welcome. No usage or production-readiness claims are implied by this initial release.
